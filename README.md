Instructions: Your task is to create a Java application that implements a simple dependency injection framework. Follow the steps outlined below to complete the assignment.
    
1.  Define the Classes: 
	- Create an interface called "cs545.DependencyInjector" with a single method "void injectDependencies(Object target)". 
	- Implement the "cs545.DependencyInjector" interface with a class called "MyDependencyInjector" that provides an implementation for the "injectDependencies" method.
2.  Implement the Dependency Injection Framework: 
	- Create a class called "Container" that acts as the dependency injection container. 
	- Add a private field in the "Container" class to store a mapping of dependencies. 
	- Implement a method in the "Container" class, e.g., "registerDependency(Class<?> clazz)", to register dependencies. 
	- Implement the "injectDependencies" method in the "MyDependencyInjector" class to perform the actual dependency injection.
    -   Use reflection to scan the target object's fields and identify the ones that are annotated with your custom injection annotation.
    -   Retrieve the corresponding dependency from the "Container" class and set it in the target object's field.
    -   Handle any exceptions that may occur during the injection process.
3.  Define the Classes to be Injected: 
	- Create a class called "UserService" with a private field of type "UserRepository". 
	- Annotate the "UserService" class field with your custom injection annotation.
    
4.  Test the Dependency Injection: 
	- In the main method of your application, create an instance of the "UserService" class. 
	- Create an instance of the "Container" class and register the "UserRepository" as a dependency. 
	- Create an instance of the "MyDependencyInjector" class and call the "injectDependencies" method, passing the "UserService" instance. 
	- Verify that the "UserService" object has the "UserRepository" dependency properly injected.
    
5.  Additional Functionality (Optional):
	- Implement another class and define additional dependencies. 
	- Modify the "Container" and "MyDependencyInjector" classes to support injecting dependencies into the new class. 
	- Test the updated implementation to ensure that the new dependencies are correctly injected.

## Submission
* Fork the repository and push your changes.
* Once you finished your project, send a Pull Request. (Send only one Pull Request once you finish the assignment.)

### Important Notes

 * You are not allowed to share codes with your classmates. If detected, you will get NC.
 * **For pairs:**
	 * Individual's work will be checked from the commits.
	 *  Share tasks evenly and fairly.
	 *  To have a clearer understanding of pair programming:
		 *  > **Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the _driver_, writes code while the other, the _observer_ or _navigator_ reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. 
		 * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#:~:text=Pair%20programming%20is%20an%20agile,two%20programmers%20switch%20roles%20frequently.)

-   Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden.
    
-   Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.
